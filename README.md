# Torsion Boundary Element Method
This repository is part of my Continuum Mechanics course project and contains a cross sectional torsion problem solver using Boundary Element Method. The detail derivation and theoretical background for the boundary element method application in torsional problem is included as PDF in the "Boundary Element Method Torsion.pdf" file.

This repository consists of 3 parts:
1. Boundary element method solver (src folder)
2. Geometry generation scripts (geometry generator folder)
3. Geometry example data (geometry folder)

# Boundary element method solver
The main code for the boundary element solver is the "main_torsion.m" file which also includes some solver parameters such as solution resolution, geometry file name, and the material properties.
